<h1>Guess the number game!</h1>
<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>This project is from this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/?kw=javascript&src=sac">course</a> on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> as an implementation on some $\color{#f0db4f
}{\textsf{JS}}$	 concepts such as <strong>DOM</strong>.</p>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>Game's UI/UX design is not mine but I coded the logic from scratch.</p>
<p>JS code provided in this repo is different from that originally in the course.</p>
